    <p>These days, you can’t just hand your children the remote and let them choose a channel. Teaching a child to read — and the importance of reading — can be a parent or teacher’s most difficult task, but the accelerated reader program makes it easier than ever. We’ve learned a lot this year, don’t you think? Whether you’re a teacher looking for a fun classroom activity or you’re a parent who loves spend quality time with your kids, riddles are a fun, easy and free way to do that. Having famous parents comes with plenty of fringe benefits, like going to red carpet premieres and being able to score tickets to coachella.</p>
